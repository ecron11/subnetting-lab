# subnetting-lab
 
 About this project:
Hello! Thanks for reading this. My name is Erik. This is the first subnetting lab I created. I used it to practice and learn some bootstrap along with some other front end things. It also presented an opportunity to solve a fun programming problem.

 What it does:
The purpose of this project is to present a webpage that a user can use to practice their CIDR notation. It can randomly generate a new question as well. This project is designed to help people trying to get ready for certification exams such as the CompTIA Network+ and CCNA.
